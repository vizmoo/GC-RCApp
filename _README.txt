Project for the RCapp signaling server AND webapp client.
Started by Ryan Dixon

BASED ON URS Sample project (pkg 3.1.0-exp.3)

Use the 'fomantic' branch (uses form of old semantic-ui project)

--- Files ---
build -- for signaling server (as best we can tell, must have config that points to 'client/public' for webapp)

semantic -- install of fomanatic (fork of obsolete semantic-ui pkg)

client - src code for webapp itself, ie front-end - modified from orig

src -- src for signaling server - in typescript! - not changed (as of 4/3/22) from orig

test -- not sure, looks like for sig server cuz it's typescript
